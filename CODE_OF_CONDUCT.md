# Code of Conduct

I, TheSovietPancakes, am a single developer working alone on passion projects.

These projects are open sourced for transparency as well as to be a place for bug reports, code fixes, and civil discussions.

As the maintainer of these projects, I will not stand for any harrassment, bullying, or shaming for any reason in any part of my control.
Making fun of anybody, from first-time contrubutors to those with disabilties or any other reason will absolutely not be tolerated.

With that being said, I hope you have a great rest of your day while you keep these statements in mind.
